# HPI2-NN: Surrogate Model for Pellet Fuelling in Tokamak Discharges


Author: Alex Panera Alvarez


## 🧩 Overview

**HPI2-NN** is a machine learning surrogate model of the **HPI2 pellet ablation and deposition code** (https://gitlab.com/hpi2_group/HPI2_code), developed to accelerate integrated modeling of pellet-fuelled tokamak discharges.

The model learns from around 4000 **HPI2 simulations** on WEST experimental data and ITER simulation data, and predicts **pellet deposition profiles** based on plasma parameters and pellet injection conditions.  
It is designed for integration into integrated modeling frameworks, enabling fast inference within integrated plasma scenario modeling.

- PCA compression of temperature and density profiles  
- Supports ONNX inference for fast runtime execution  
- Modular code for evaluation

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/DIFFER-NL/hpi2nn.git
cd hpi2nn

(Optional) Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install onnxruntime

The onnxruntime version used for this project is 1.22.0

## Quick Inference Example

Shown on inference/simple_inference

Inputs: Pellet radius in m, velocity in m/s, Te and Ti profiles in eV, ne profile in m-3, B0 in T, first point (R1,Z1) and second point (R2,Z2) in m
x coord preferred in rho_tor_norm, but using a_norm will not impact too much the result 
B0 is suppose to be negative always (inforced anyway in inference)

Outputs: deposition profile dne (m-3) and temperatura change profile dTe (eV) same x coord as given in input

For JETTO implementation--> inference/HPI2-NN_JETTO.py
FOR JETTO multiply ne by 1e6


## 📈 Training and Data

HPI2-NN was trained using synthetic data from HPI2 simulations under various plasma conditions representative of WEST and ITER configurations.
A different NN has been trained for every injection line and tokamak.
